# MCP Tavily Deep Research with System Date Injection

## Critical Rules

- For any user request involving deep research, always use the MCP Tavily tool for web search and research tasks.
- Before making any Tavily (MCP) request, always run the system's `date` command to get the current system date and time.
- Inject the retrieved system date/time into all Tavily requests, either as a parameter or in the query context, to ensure time-contextual accuracy.
- Never rely on the AI's internal or training data date/time for time-sensitive research; always use the actual system date/time.
- If the system date/time cannot be retrieved, inform the user and do not proceed with the research request.

## Examples

<example>
  User: "Please do deep research on the latest AI trends."
  Agent: Runs `date` to get the current system date/time, then uses MCP Tavily for the search, injecting the date/time into the query or context.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Do deep research on 2025 tech events."
  Agent: Uses MCP Tavily but does not check or inject the current system date/time, leading to potentially outdated or contextually incorrect results.
</example>
