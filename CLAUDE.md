This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview


**Primary Goal**: 

**Current Status**: Active development with modular Terraform structure
**Target Platform**: 
**Core Technologies**: NetScaler VPX, Terraform, VMware vSphere, BGP routing

## Repository Architecture


### Key Directories

## Development Workflow


## Key Configuration Files

## Development Notes

## User Preferences and Workflow (dima@lejkin.de)

### Communication Style
- **Primary Language**: German for communication and discussions
- **Code Language**: English for code comments, variable names, and technical documentation
- **Response Style**: Direct, concise answers - avoid lengthy explanations unless requested

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning First**: Create detailed plans in markdown files (saved to `docs/`) before implementation
2. **Todo Management**: Use TodoWrite/TodoRead tools extensively for complex tasks
3. **Modular Implementation**: Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
4. **Testing**: Always validate with `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` after changes
5. **Documentation**: Keep README.md and documentation current with implementation

### Git and Commit Preferences
- **Commit Style**: Concise, descriptive German commit messages
- **Co-Author**: Always include `Co-Authored-By: dima@lejkin.de`
- **No Claude Branding**: Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" lines in commits
- **Tagging**: Create version tags for major feature completions
- **Branch Management**: Work on feature branches, clean up obsolete files

### Code Standards
- **Breaking Changes**: Document explicitly with migration guides
- **Terraform**: Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` before commits
- **Variable Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming (e.g., `two_adc` instead of `netscaler_count`)
- **Configuration**: Prefer centralized configuration (`terraform.auto.tfvars`) over multiple files
