# Ansible Configuration Management

This directory contains Ansible playbooks and configurations for Citrix DaaS infrastructure setup and management.

## Structure

```
ansible/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── playbooks/                   # Ansible playbooks (to be created)
├── inventory/                   # Inventory files (to be created)
├── group_vars/                  # Group variables (to be created)
├── host_vars/                   # Host variables (to be created)
└── roles/                       # Custom Ansible roles (to be created)
```

## Usage

1. Configure inventory files with target hosts
2. Customize variables in group_vars/ and host_vars/
3. Run playbooks: `ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/site.yml`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Citrix DaaS Playbooks**: Automated Citrix Cloud Connector setup
- **VMware Integration**: vSphere host configuration
- **Security Hardening**: OS and application security configurations
- **Monitoring Setup**: Observability and alerting configuration

## Best Practices

- Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data
- Structure playbooks with clear task separation
- Test playbooks in development environment first
- Document all custom variables and their purposes
- Follow Ansible naming conventions

## Integration

- Coordinates with Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Executes post-deployment configuration tasks
- Manages ongoing infrastructure maintenance
